# Resume-Analyzer
A resume analyzer using regular expressions to extract specific information out of a resume.

It is a tool or program that uses a set of predefined patterns in the form of regular expressions to extract specific information from a resume. This information can include a candidate's name, contact information, education, work experience, and other relevant details. The extracted information is then used to create a structured representation of the candidate's qualifications and experience, which can be used for things like resume screening, candidate matching, and other HR tasks. The regular expressions used by the tool will be carefully crafted to match the specific format and content of the resumes being analyzed.
